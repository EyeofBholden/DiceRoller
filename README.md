# DiceRoller - Mid 2023

This was a personal physics based dice roller using Unit and C#

Basic concept is randomly oriented D6's are bounced around an invisible dice tower. dice self flag once no longer moving and reader records value.

can be easily ran ontop of any dice based game where designer wants visible dice.

Note, the dice do not know their value before rolling, so logic can not begin until all dice report.
